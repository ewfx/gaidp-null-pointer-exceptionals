## 🎯 Introduction
Regulatory reporting in the banking sector requires institutions to submit large volumes of data while ensuring compliance with strict regulatory guidelines. Traditionally, data validation is done manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project aims to automate regulatory data validation using Generative AI (LLMs like Gemini/GPT) and machine learning techniques. The system will extract validation rules from regulatory documents (e.g., Federal Reserve's FR Y-14Q guidelines) and validate CSV reports against these rules.
